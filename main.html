        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ausculation is a procedure commonly done on large mammals to listen to sounds associated with the lungs, heart, pleura, and areas of the abdomen. Being able to listen to the sounds of an animal benefit both the health of the animal and the production and profit of a farm. In particular, the predicatble nature of heart sounds of large animals make them a viable target for signal processing. This would reduce the need to have a trained professional onsite to evaluate an animal. Our design is a Bluetooth-enabled digital stethoscope that will quickly get a heart rate. We are using MATLAB to anaylze and filter the audio. MATLAB will also provide an easy to understand protocol for the consumer to user and filtered recordings for future use.</p>
                
        <h3>Design Objectives</h3>
        <p>The design objectives of the project are as follows:
            
<!--            Make this into a bullet somehow pleasesee-->
            
            <l1>Be simple to use</l1>
            <l2>Be inexpensive to manufacture</l2>
            <l3>Have a signal processing protocol to cleary find heartbeats</l3>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Our digital sethoscope takes advantage of currently used sethoscope technology as well as a commerically available Bluetooth headset. The Bluetooth headset is positioned next to the sethoscope bell and is insulated around the junction point with foam and shrink wrap to reduce the noise. The microphone function of the headset is used to record the heart sounds from the sethoscope.

        <h3>In Silico and In Vivio Testing</h3>
        <p>For the in silico testing, we used three normal recordings of horse heart sounds to test the filter and the ability of the MATLAB protocol to determine heart rate. For in vivo data collection, a ~300 day pregnany mare was used as a subject. The data collected was collected from various points by placing the device on the pregnany mare's belly in an open space.
