        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The results from the in silico testing suggest that a heart rate close to the expected heart rate can be determined by the MATLAB protocol from a horse heart sound recording. The initial in vivo reuslts are import because they show that the hardware and software has the ability to collect and filter heart sounds from a horse.

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Directions</h3>
        <p>Our design for a Bluetooth-Enabled Stethoscope to Determine Heart Rate in Large Mammals was successful in the detection of the heart rate in a horse. We will continue to work on the refinement of our MATLAB code and prototype to remove the additional background noise found in audio recordings and graphs. We plan on expanding the capabilities of our design to detect fetal heartbeat audio for determining pregnancy. We plan to do additional testing on mares in different stages of pregnancy.

        In the future, we hope to add extra functionality to our website. We would like people to be able to upload their own data to add to our sound database, through both a file upload and audio recording. We would also like to add machine learning to analyze the sounds, eventually being able to detect different symptoms, such as pregnancy.
